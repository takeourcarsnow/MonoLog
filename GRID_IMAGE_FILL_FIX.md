# Grid Image Fill Fix

## Problem
In the Explore and Feed grid views, images were not filling their tile frames. Images with different aspect ratios would have whitespace (letterboxing), making the grid look inconsistent compared to the Profile grid view.

## Root Cause
The `.tile img` CSS rule was using `object-fit: contain`, which displays the entire image but leaves empty space around it to maintain the original aspect ratio.

## Solution

### Changed: `app/globals.css`

**Before:**
```css
.tile img {
  object-fit: contain; /* show full image without cropping */
}
```

**After:**
```css
.tile img {
  object-fit: cover; /* Fill the frame, crop if needed */
}
```

## Visual Comparison

### Before (object-fit: contain):
```
┌─────────┬─────────┬─────────┐
│ ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓ │░░░░░░░░░│ ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓ │
│ ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓ │░▓▓▓▓▓▓░│ ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓ │ ← Whitespace
│ ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓ │░▓▓▓▓▓▓░│ ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓ │    around portrait
│ ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓ │░░░░░░░░░│ ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓ │    images
└─────────┴─────────┴─────────┘
```

### After (object-fit: cover):
```
┌─────────┬─────────┬─────────┐
│ ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓ │ ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓ │ ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓ │
│ ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓ │ ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓ │ ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓ │ ← All tiles
│ ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓ │ ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓ │ ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓ │    filled
│ ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓ │ ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓ │ ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓ │    completely
└─────────┴─────────┴─────────┘
```

## Behavior

### With `object-fit: cover`:
- ✅ Images fill the entire square tile
- ✅ Aspect ratio is maintained (no stretching)
- ✅ Images may be cropped at edges to fill the frame
- ✅ Center of image is always visible (`object-position: center`)
- ✅ Grid looks clean and consistent

### What Users See:
1. **Landscape photos** (wide): Top/bottom may be cropped
2. **Portrait photos** (tall): Left/right may be cropped
3. **Square photos**: Fit perfectly with no cropping
4. **All photos**: Fill the tile completely

## Affected Views

This change applies to all grid views:
- ✅ **Explore** page grid view
- ✅ **Feed** page grid view (when grid toggle is selected)
- ✅ **Profile** page grid view
- ✅ **Calendar** page grid (if used)

## Benefits

1. **Consistent Look**: All tiles are uniformly filled
2. **Professional Feel**: Like Instagram/Pinterest grids
3. **No Whitespace**: Clean, tight grid layout
4. **Focus on Content**: Eye is drawn to the photos, not empty space
5. **Mobile-Friendly**: Looks great on all screen sizes

## Trade-offs

### Before (contain):
- ✅ Shows entire image
- ❌ Whitespace looks messy
- ❌ Inconsistent visual rhythm

### After (cover):
- ✅ Clean, uniform grid
- ✅ Professional appearance
- ⚠️ Some image edges may be cropped
- ℹ️ Click to view full image in detail view

## User Impact

Users can still see the full, uncropped image by:
1. Clicking on any grid tile
2. Viewing the post in detail/card view
3. The grid is just a preview/thumbnail

This is standard behavior for all photo grid platforms (Instagram, Pinterest, Google Photos, etc.).

## Testing

Test scenarios:
- [x] Landscape photos (16:9, 4:3)
- [x] Portrait photos (9:16, 3:4)
- [x] Square photos (1:1)
- [x] Extreme aspect ratios (panoramas, tall portraits)
- [x] Mobile viewport (320px - 640px)
- [x] Tablet viewport (640px - 900px)
- [x] Desktop viewport (900px+)

All should show fully filled tiles with centered cropping.
