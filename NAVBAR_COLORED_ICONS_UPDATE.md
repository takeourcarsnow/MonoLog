# Navbar Icon Color Update

## Change Summary
Updated navbar so that **selected icons stay colored** (not white) on both desktop and mobile devices.

## What Changed

### Before
- Active icons turned white
- Only the indicator behind showed color
- Icons lost their unique color when selected

### After
- Active icons **stay colored** with their unique theme color
- Each tab maintains its identity when selected:
  - ðŸ”µ Feed: Blue (`#3b82f6`)
  - ðŸŸ£ Explore: Purple (`#a855f7`)
  - ðŸŸ¢ Post: Green (`#22c55e`)
  - ðŸŸ  Calendar: Orange (`#f59e0b`)
  - ðŸ©· Profile: Pink (`#ec4899`)
- Colored glow/shadow effects enhance the active icon
- Works consistently on **all devices** (desktop, tablet, mobile)

## Technical Changes

### Updated CSS Rules
1. Changed active icon color from `white` to individual theme colors
2. Removed light mode overrides that forced dark strokes
3. Added colored drop-shadow filters for depth
4. Maintained all animations and transitions

### Files Modified
- `app/globals.css` - Updated color rules for active states

## Visual Result
- **Hover**: Icon shows subtle color (80% opacity)
- **Active**: Icon shows vibrant color with glowing shadow
- **Indicator**: Matches the icon's color with gradient
- **Consistent**: Same appearance on phone, tablet, and desktop

## Benefits
