Maybe we should say "log" instead of "post" throughout the app for consistency
when rotating crop in so theres no empty canvas


photo editor should subtly blur in
text turns from confirm to delete in delete button
Turn off background focus effect on edit post button 

Zoom in when rotating image
Remove click effect from reset settings button 

Discard draft button is white with red outline in light theme instead of red

Navbar highlight should overscroll/ruberscroll if im trying to scroll left from first position or right from last position 



For a totally new user visiting website first time it should open up with a smal intro splash and when u close it it should be in explore section by default
