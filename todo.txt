subtly animate logo on hover or click
when i scroll to top or bottom on phone it should bounce back not just stop instantly
on phone make sure that double tapping also properly favorites/unfavorites the post like it does on desktop, now it zooms in on double tap

Profile section takes a long time to load and the section highlighter lags because of it until the last tab's highlight switches off


make doubletapping on phone on photo not zoom in or take me to the post's page but just favorite/unfavorite like it does on desktop
